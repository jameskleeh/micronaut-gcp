Pub/Sub support in micronaut follows the same pattern used for other types of clients such as --the HTTP Client.
By annotating an interface with `@PubSubclient` the framework will create an implementation bean that handles
communication with PubSub for you.

== Topics

In order to publish messages to Pub/Sub you need a method annotated with `@Topic` annotation. For each annotated method
the framework will create a dedicated `Publisher` with its own configuration for `RetrySettings`, `BatchSettings` and
its own `Executor`. All settings can be overridden via properties file or via method annotation.

<1> The `PubSubClient` marks this interface to be a valid Publisher
<2> Headers can be passed and will be added to the `attributesMap` of the `PubSubMessage`

IMPORTANT: If a body argument cannot be found, an exception will be thrown.
